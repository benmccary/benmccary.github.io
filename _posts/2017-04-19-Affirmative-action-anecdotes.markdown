At my job I get to tell companies when they don't hire, fire, promote, or pay fairly. It's kind of an honor, but often times it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. I was recently working with a mid-sized company in the PNW and I remember going through the standard stuff. I don't remember the specifics, but it's the typical stuff that comes up with most companies, "you're paying your female executives significantly less than the men, promoting working class black men at a significantly lower rate than whites, etc." It was the standard gig and their HR director was actually working hard to fix their issues.

But last week I was driving to work and I saw one of their delivery drivers out on a trip. He looked like a middle age black man, and it struck home: these aren't just statistics and reports. I've spent about a month reminding someone 4 or 5 levels up the chain that he deserves a fair shot at a promotion. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was him I was talking about.

Every day I get to work with a totally unique and amazingly telling dataset. I hope we can anonymize the data and release it publicly, and I hope to convince my company to publish reports on it. There are a lot of things that will go in to making that possible, but in the meantime, I do have some purely anecdotal observations. So as always, take these with a grain of salt until we can give some numbers to back it all up.

### Purely Anecdotal Observations
1. Among the companies I've worked with, minorities are significantly less likely to be promoted than their white peers. This is particularly frustrating to me because a typical raise is about 3-5%, while a promotion ranges from 10% to 30%. That means that minorities are often forced to leave their jobs to try to move up.

2. Companies with female CEO/Presidents seem to have more pay equality among executives, but...

3. Pay discrepancies are the largest at the executive level, and worst between men and women (next is whites and minorities)

4. I've yet to see a Native American executive in the companies I've worked with.

5. I've yet to meet any HR professional who isn't actively trying to fix all of the above areas - they're usually trying pretty hard. But it ultimately comes down to the men and women who do the actual hiring and setting of salaries. And, it's ultimately up to the executives if those individuals ever see any of the information on how they may be contributing to unfair practices. So it's usually up to a group of 5-6 people to decide whether any of this is ever addressed in a company.

### So, what can you do?
If you work for a federal contractor, ask if they have an Affirmative Action Plan (there should be a sign up in the lunch room saying you have one if you do). Peruse your company's AAP and see if your company is doing well or not. One thing that can help is making sure that training opportunities are distributed equally: be sure that everyone gets a shot at career advancement.

If you're a hiring manager, or manage salaries, do some simple arithmetic to see if everyone is getting paid similarly. And, if not, maybe ask around to find out why. Are there policies that let people be paid above the maximum in the range for seniority? Do you set salaries based on prior pay rates? Sometimes the reasons are easily substantiated, but sometimes it's just the fact that no one has ever thought to check.

There are plenty of other things people can do to try to help, but the most important thing is to realize that this is a real issue. A little privilege (or disadvantage) distributed throughout a whole system quickly compounds into uneven growth rates between demographics. That means a certain type of person gets wealthy, while all others get left behind and no one has to take responsibility. We end up with a world very much like the one I didn't really realize we're living in.
